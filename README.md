# cdevops-gitea
k8s gitea lab to take dev (sqlite based) to prod (mysql based)

TLDR;

```bash
cd dev && ansible-playbook up.yaml
```

If that fails you may need some pre-requisites

1. Make sure that docker is running by doing `docker ps` until it shows 

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                             NAMES

```

2. run `ansible-playbook --version` to see if you have ansible. If not run:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conestogac-acsit/cdevops-bootstrap/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

3. run `kubectl get ns default` to see if you have a cluster. The expected result is:

```
NAME      STATUS   AGE
default   Active   29m
```

If you have another result try installing a k8s cluster:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com//conestogac-acsit/cdevops-bootstrap/refs/heads/main/k8s.sh)
```

Once you have made it through the `up.yaml` playbook you can forward the port:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/gitea-http 3000:3000
```

Now you should be able to access gitea in development mode.

The challenge is to run this in production mode from a prod folder at the same level as the dev folder with it's own up, down and values.yaml.
